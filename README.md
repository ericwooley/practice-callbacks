## Practice callbacks instructions

### 1. `numberMucker` function setup.
1. Create a function called numberMucker
2. In the function body, generate 2 random numbers, between 1 and 1000.
3. Return the multiple of two numbers.

### 2. Create a new function to use a callback to generate the random numbers
1. Create a function called `genNumber` which returns a number between 1 and 1000.
1. Copy `numberMucker`, to `numberMucker2`
2. Modify numberMucker2 to accept a callback function as it's first parameter, named `callback1`.
3. Use the callback function to generate your two numbers random numbers inside numberMucker (instead of generating two random numbers inline)
4. `numberMucker2` should still return the multiples of those numbers.

### 3. Create a new function `numberMucker3` to do arbitrary math based on a callback
1. Create a function `multipleTwoNumbers` that returns the multiple of two numbers, which it gets as parameters
2. Add a second argument to `numberMucker`, callback2
3. Modify `numberMucker`, so that it no longer returns numbers which are multiplied by each other, but instead it should return the result of calling `callback2` with the two numbers that are being generated by `callback1`
4. Modify the `numMucker` call, to accept `multipleTwoNumbers` as it's second argument.
